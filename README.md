# face-detection-cnn-v1
Version 1 of a Convolutional Neural Network trained with 200,000 images of celebrities to detect standard facial features (smiling, attractiveness, glasses, etc). Currently optimizing and revamping this project, as well as an implementation of this model onto a website. To run it for now, download the pretrained model here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rl8AH0e4BLdb3lMrH8UKpxI7cc2n49cd/view?usp=sharing ; then run main.py.
