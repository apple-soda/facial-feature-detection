# face-detection-cnn-v1
Version 1 of a Convolutional Neural Network trained with 200,000 images of celebrities to detect standard facial features (smiling, attractiveness, glasses, etc). Currently optimizing and revamping this project, as well as an implementation of this model onto a website (flask does not work properly yet).

REQUIREMENTS:
packages: pytorch, opencv, tqdm

full packages (to train yourself): pytorch, opencv, tqdm, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, flask

Thenm download the pretrained model here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rl8AH0e4BLdb3lMrH8UKpxI7cc2n49cd/view?usp=sharing and https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pjc_qy7PE6h-FQxXR0loSdMiU1Oxzi_l/view?usp=sharing; then run main.py. (%run -i main.py) in python console in jupyter lab.
